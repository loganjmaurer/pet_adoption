A Binary Classification Problem

Data here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-pet-adoption-status-dataset/data

I am comparing the performance of various methods from both machine learning and traditional statistics. 
The task is a simple binary classification for the liklihood of pet adoption based on the type of pet,
breed, age, weight, fee, health and more.
